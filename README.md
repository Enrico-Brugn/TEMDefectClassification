Hi! You've reached the code repository corresponding to the paper ["Learning-based Defect Recognition for Quasi-Periodic Microscope Images"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01309), authored by Nik Dennler, Antonio Foncubierta-Rodriguez, Titus Neupert and Marilyne Sousa. 

Currently this repository is under construction, and will be updated with the latest code pushes as soon as possible. In case you urgently would like to test the model or use the data, please [write us](mailto:nik.dennler@uzh.ch).
